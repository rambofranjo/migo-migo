<p>HelmaLib is organized into two groups of modules:</p>

<ul>
<li>modules/core which contains extensions to core JavaScript types such as
Object, Array, or Date.</li>
<li>modules/helma which provides new functionality to JavaScript, usually by
wrapping a Java library.</li>
</ul>

<p>To use a HelmaLib module in your Helma application, you need to add it to the
app's repositories. The simplest way to do so is by using the app.addRepository()
function:</p>

<pre>  app.addRepository("modules/helma/Search.js");</pre>
